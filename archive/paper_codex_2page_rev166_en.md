(Abstract)

Failbit Maps are ultra-high-resolution data generated in semiconductor EDS tests, with roughly 10 million pixels per wafer, and are a key source for defect-pattern analysis. However, in practical operations, large-scale retrieval and inspection of Failbit Maps have not been possible, and even the limited analysis that was feasible relied heavily on manual inspection by engineers. This work addresses that limitation by building a large-scale Failbit Map data pipeline and implementing an architecture in which Known defects are handled by two-stage supervised classification and Unknown defects are discovered by self-supervised learning. Data transformation speed was improved by about 100x through Cython, while the image storage footprint was reduced by about 75% through a 32-color palette-indexed PNG. For Known defects, a ConvNeXtV2-based first-stage classifier was combined with a second-stage ROI (Region of Interest)-based YOLO classifier for low-confidence samples, achieving a weighted F1 of 0.95. For Unknown defects, a SimCLR-family model was trained with contrastive learning using grid-structured local sampling to reflect the zone-based nature of wafer defect interpretation. After training on 10,000 Failbit Maps collected over five production days, the model was applied to 2,000 maps from an additional day. It detected 13 defect groups, 7 of which were confirmed by domain engineers as real defect groups, demonstrating practical applicability in production.

## 1. INTRODUCTION

A Failbit Map represents defect severity at the memory-cell-block level in EDS testing using grades from 0 to 7. Because a single wafer contains roughly 10 million blocks, it is an ultra-high-resolution representation of defect location and morphology. In current practice, Measure-based analysis alone cannot capture this information, making exhaustive Failbit Map analysis necessary.

Two limitations have hindered practical adoption in production. First, the existing system did not have sufficient processing performance to transform equipment logs into large numbers of Failbit Maps and to store and browse them at scale. Equipment logs are typically 10 to 50 MB per wafer, and roughly 20,000 wafers are produced per day across all products. Under the previous environment, large-volume processing was limited by speed and memory constraints, and the number of maps that could be checked at once was restricted to about 48. Second, even when maps were generated, defect determination and type identification still depended on manual inspection by engineers, making exhaustive analysis difficult. To address these limitations, this paper proposes an integrated analysis architecture. The main contributions are as follows.

First, we implemented a real-time log ingestion and hourly Failbit Map generation pipeline, establishing a data-processing foundation for large-scale map operations. Second, for Known defects, we improved classification performance with a two-stage structure combining a ConvNeXt V2-based wafer-level first-stage classifier and an ROI-based YOLO second-stage classifier. Third, for Unknown defects, we applied a SimCLR-family self-supervised analysis with grid-structured local sampling for more precise detection.

## 2. PROPOSED METHOD

The architecture consists of a data pipeline, a two-stage Known classifier, and a self-supervised Unknown detector, deployed as a dedicated analysis web application[1].

### 2.1 DATA PIPELINE

The data pipeline was designed to ingest equipment raw logs in real time and generate Failbit Maps on an hourly basis. The main bottlenecks were the hex-to-grade conversion speed for roughly 10 million encoded test values per wafer and the storage footprint of the resulting images; the former was accelerated by about 100x with Cython (Fig. 1), and the latter was reduced by about 75% with a 32-color palette-indexed PNG (Fig. 2). Generated maps are stored in a central repository and served through the analysis web application[1] for large-scale browsing and analysis.

### 2.2 Known Defect Classification

Known-defect analysis targeted 16 registered classes. We designed a two-stage structure combining a ConvNeXtV2[2]-based wafer-level first-stage classifier and a second-stage ROI (Region of Interest)-based YOLO for low-confidence samples, and trained it on 1,500 labeled Failbit Maps.
While the ConvNeXtV2-based wafer-level classifier showed high overall accuracy and throughput, its performance degraded on classes with similar wafer-level distributions of defective chips. To compensate for this, in the second stage ROI-based YOLO re-examines low-confidence samples and identifies chip-level defect morphologies and appearance patterns within the ROI (Fig. 3).

**Fig. 3.** Representative patterns of Class A(a) and Class B(b), and a true Class A sample(c) misclassified as Class B by the first-stage CNN but corrected to Class A by the second-stage ROI-YOLO. The blue circle indicates the ROI, and the red boxes denote YOLO detections of chip-level defect patterns within the ROI.


**Table 1.** Backbone comparison and staged improvements for known-fail classification (16-class, test weighted F1)

| Configuration | Pre Train | Test F1 | Note |
|---|---|---:|---|
| ViT | IN-21k | 0.81 | fine-tune |
| Swin | IN-1k | 0.84 | fine-tune |
| EffNetV2 | IN-1k | 0.85 | fine-tune |
| MaxViT | IN-21k | 0.87 | fine-tune |
| ConvNeXtV2 (Ref) | IN-22k | 0.87 | selected |
| Ref + Optuna | IN-22k | 0.92 | HPO |
| Ref + Optuna + ROI | IN-22k | 0.95 | 2-stage |

MaxViT[3] and ConvNeXtV2 (Ref) achieved the same weighted F1 of 0.87, but ConvNeXtV2 was selected as the final backbone because it was more efficient, with about 26% fewer parameters (119.5M → 88.6M) and about 39% fewer FLOPs (74.2G → 45.1G). Optuna was then used to optimize fine-tuning hyperparameters such as learning rate, weight decay, focal loss, and class weights, improving weighted F1 to 0.92, and ROI-YOLO refinement further increased the final score to 0.95.

### 2.3 Unknown Defect Discovery

Using 10,000 production maps from five days, a SimCLR[3]-family model was trained with contrastive learning using grid-structured local sampling to reflect the zone-based nature of wafer defect interpretation. HDBSCAN[4] was then applied to a separate set of 2,000 maps from one additional day to group similar patterns.

For Unknown defects, grouping on 2,000 production images yielded 13 candidate groups, and validation by domain engineers confirmed that 7 of them were real defect groups. The remaining 6 were lot-specific warnings or non-defect patterns.

## 3. CONCLUSION

This study implemented an integrated architecture for end-to-end Failbit Map generation and automated defect analysis. Cython optimization and a 32-color palette-indexed PNG enabled large-scale map generation, storage, and operational use, while the combination of Known two-stage classification and Unknown self-supervised discovery established an automated defect-analysis workflow.
